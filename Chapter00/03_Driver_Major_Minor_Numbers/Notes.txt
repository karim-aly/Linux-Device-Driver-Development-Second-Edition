List all devices major numbers:
$ cat /proc/devices


To know the major and minor number of devices:
# info is in the 5th and 6th column
$ ls -l /dev


Create a device driver file manually (c: character, major:50, minor:0):
$ sudo mknod /dev/hello_test c 50 0
$ sudo chmod 777 /dev/hello_test


Delete the file manually:
$ sudo rm /dev/test
